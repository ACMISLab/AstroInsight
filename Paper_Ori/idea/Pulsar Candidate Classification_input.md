Pulsar Candidates Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
## abstract
As performance of dedicated facilities continually improved, massive pulsar candidates are being received, which makes selecting valuable pulsar signals from candidates challenging. In this paper, we designed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with 11 layers for classifying pulsar candidates. Compared to artificial designed features, CNN chose sub-integrations plot and sub-bands plot in each candidate as inputs without carrying biases. To address the imbalanced problem, data augmentation method based on synthetic minority samples is proposed according to characteristics of pulsars. The maximum pulses of pulsar candidates were first translated to the same position, then new samples were generated by adding up multiple subplots of pulsars. The data augmentation method is simple and effective for obtaining varied and representative samples which keep pulsar characteristics. In the experiments on HTRU 1 dataset, it shows that this model can achieve recall as 0.962 while precision as 0.963.

Pulsar Candidate Selection Using Ensemble Networks for FAST Drift-Scan Survey
## abstract
The Commensal Radio Astronomy Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) Survey (CRAFTS) utilizes the novel drift-scan commensal survey mode of FAST and can generate billions of pulsar candidate signals. The human experts are not likely to thoroughly examine these signals, and various machine sorting methods are used to aid the classification of the FAST candidates. In this study, we propose a new ensemble classification system for pulsar candidates. This system denotes the further development of the pulsar image-based classification system (PICS), which was used in the Arecibo Telescope pulsar survey, and has been retrained and customized for the FAST drift-scan survey. In this study, we designed a residual network model comprising 15 layers to replace the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in PICS. The results of this study demonstrate that the new model can sort >96% of real pulsars to belong the top 1% of all candidates and classify >1.6 million candidates per day using a dual--GPU and 24--core computer. This increased speed and efficiency can help to facilitate real-time or quasi-real-time processing of the pulsar-search data stream obtained from CRAFTS. In addition, we have published the labeled FAST data used in this study online, which can aid in the development of new deep learning techniques for performing pulsar searches.

Searching for X-ray counterparts of unassociated Fermi-LAT sources and rotation-powered pulsars with SRG/eROSITA
## abstract
The latest source catalog of the Fermi-LAT telescope contains more than 7000 $\gamma$-ray sources at GeV energies, with the two dominant source classes thought to be blazars and rotation-powered pulsars. Our target is the identification of possible (young and recycled) pulsar candidates in the sample of 2600 unassociated $\gamma$-ray sources, via their characteristic X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission. To achieve this, we cross-match the Fermi-LAT catalog with the catalog of X-ray sources in the western Galactic hemisphere from the first four all-sky surveys of SRG/eROSITA. We complement this by identifying X-ray counterparts of known pulsars detected at $\gamma$-ray and radio energies in the eROSITA data. We use a Bayesian cross-matching scheme to construct a probabilistic catalog of possible pulsar-type X-ray counterparts to Fermi-LAT sources. Our method combines the overlap of X-ray and $\gamma$-ray source positions with a probabilistic classification (into pulsar and blazar candidates) of each source based on its $\gamma$-ray properties and a prediction on the X-ray flux of pulsar- or blazar-type counterparts. We provide a catalog of our prior $\gamma$-ray-based classifications of all 2600 unassociated sources in the Fermi-LAT catalog, with around equal numbers of pulsar and blazar candidates. Our final list of candidate X-ray pulsar counterparts, cleaned for spurious detections and sources with obvious non-pulsar counterparts, contains around 900 X-ray sources. We predict between 30 and 40 new pulsars among our top 200 candidates, with around equal expected numbers of young and recycled pulsars. This candidate list may serve as input to future follow-up campaigns, looking directly for pulsations or for the orbital modulation of possible binary companions. We furthermore detect the X-ray counterparts of 15 known rotation-powered pulsars, which were not seen in X-rays before.

Fifty Years of Pulsar Candidate Selection: From simple filters to a new principled real-time classification approach
## abstract
Improving survey specifications are causing an exponential rise in pulsar candidate numbers and data volumes. We study the candidate filters used to mitigate these problems during the past fifty years. We find that some existing methods such as applying constraints on the total number of candidates collected per observation, may have detrimental effects on the success of pulsar searches. Those methods immune to such effects are found to be ill-equipped to deal with the problems associated with increasing data volumes and candidate numbers, motivating the development of new approaches. We therefore present a new method designed for on-line operation. It selects promising candidates using a purpose-built tree-based machine learning classifier, the Gaussian Hellinger Very Fast Decision Tree (GH-VFDT), and a new set of features for describing candidates. The features have been chosen so as to i) maximise the separation between candidates arising from noise and those of probable astrophysical origin, and ii) be as survey-independent as possible. Using these features our new approach can process millions of candidates in seconds (~1 million every 15 seconds), with high levels of pulsar recall (90%+). This technique is therefore applicable to the large volumes of data expected to be produced by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Use of this approach has assisted in the discovery of 20 new pulsars in data obtained during the LOFAR Tied-Array All-Sky Survey (LOTAAS).

The High Time Resolution Universe Pulsar Survey-XIX. A coherent GPU accelerated reprocessing and the discovery of 71 pulsars in the Southern Galactic plane
## abstract
We have conducted a GPU accelerated reprocessing of $\sim 87\%$ of the archival data from the High Time Resolution Universe South Low Latitude (HTRU-S LowLat) pulsar survey by implementing a pulsar search pipeline that was previously used to reprocess the Parkes Multibeam pulsar survey (PMPS). We coherently searched the full 72-min observations of the survey with an acceleration search range up to $|50|\, \rm m\,s^{-2}$, which is most sensitive to binary pulsars experiencing nearly constant acceleration during 72 minutes of their orbital period. Here we report the discovery of 71 pulsars, including 6 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) of which five are in binary systems, and seven pulsars with very high dispersion measures (DM $>800 \, \rm pc \, cm^{-3}$). These pulsar discoveries largely arose by folding candidates to a much lower spectral signal-to-noise ratio than previous surveys, and exploiting the coherence of folding over the incoherent summing of the Fourier components to discover new pulsars as well as candidate classification techniques. We show that these pulsars could be fainter and on average more distant as compared to both the previously reported 100 HTRU-S LowLat pulsars and background pulsar population in the survey region. We have assessed the effectiveness of our search method and the overall pulsar yield of the survey. We show that through this reprocessing we have achieved the expected survey goals including the predicted number of pulsars in the survey region and discuss the major causes as to why these pulsars were missed in previous processings of the survey.
