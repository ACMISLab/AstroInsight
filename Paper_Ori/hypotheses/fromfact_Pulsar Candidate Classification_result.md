Hypothesis 1: A cross-modal autoencoder framework leveraging amplitude and phase information from pulsar signals will improve classification accuracy by reducing noise and enhancing discriminative feature extraction.

Derivation Process:
- Information Considered: 4, 6, 13, 46, 114, 116, 127
- Theory Applied: Inductive reasoning (generalizing from autoencoder successes in WiFi sensing, geological mapping, and noise reduction)
- Reasoning: AutoSen (Info 4,46) demonstrates cross-modal autoencoders effectively eliminate noise in unlabeled CSI data while retaining structural features. Similarly, stacked autoencoders outperform PCA in hierarchical feature extraction (Info 116). Pulsar signals contain amplitude/phase variations corrupted by radio frequency interference; inductively applying this framework could isolate pulsar-specific patterns.

Theoretical Basis:
- Inductive Reasoning: Repeated success of autoencoders in noise reduction (Info 6,13) and cross-modal fusion (Info 4,46) suggests general applicability to pulsar data. Autoencoders' encoding-decoding structure (Info 13) aligns with pulsar signal denoising needs.

Hypothesis 2: Combining ensemble learning with synthetic minority oversampling for pulsar candidates will mitigate class imbalance more effectively than standalone methods by addressing both inter-class and intra-class data scarcity.

Derivation Process:
- Information Considered: 8, 26, 40, 57, 80, 137, 168, 177
- Theory Applied: Deductive reasoning (applying established class imbalance solutions to pulsar classification)
- Reasoning: Ensemble methods like DuBE (Info 82) explicitly balance inter/intra-class distributions, while SMOTE (Info 59) handles minority oversampling. Since pulsar datasets (e.g., HTRU2) suffer extreme imbalance (Info 142), deductively integrating these methods (as in Info 168) should improve recall without overfitting.

Theoretical Basis:
- Deductive Reasoning: Class imbalance theory (Info 177) states standard classifiers fail on rare classes. Combining SMOTE (synthetic data) with ensemble weighting (Info 80) logically addresses pulsars' dual scarcity of samples and discriminative features.

Hypothesis 3: Adapting the Adapt-to-Learn mechanism for transfer learning between radio pulsars and X-ray pulsars will reduce sample complexity by reusing policy representations from related electromagnetic regimes.

Derivation Process:
- Information Considered: 2, 14, 17, 36, 88, 103, 161
- Theory Applied: Deductive reasoning (transferability theory) + Inductive reasoning (success in policy transfer)
- Reasoning: Adapt-to-Learn (Info 17) enables efficient transfer between tasks with transition differences. Pulsars emit multi-wavelength signals; deductively applying this mechanism to share latent representations (e.g., periodicity features) between radio/X-ray domains could leverage shared physics while adapting to modality-specific noise.

Theoretical Basis:
- Transferability Theory: Transferability (Info 14) allows knowledge reuse across domains. ART's theoretical guarantees (Info 36) support adapting source policies (e.g., radio pulsar classifiers) to target tasks (X-ray classification) with bounded risk.

Hypothesis 4: A self-supervised graph autoencoder modeling pulsar candidate relationships will outperform CNNs in identifying rare pulsar types by capturing sparse logical anomalies in feature space.

Derivation Process:
- Information Considered: 16, 90, 131, 175, 182, 194
- Theory Applied: Inductive reasoning (graph-based anomaly detection successes)
- Reasoning: SLSG (Info 131,182) uses graph convolutions to detect contextual anomalies, while AnomalyNCD (Info 175) isolates anomalies via contrastive learning. Pulsar false positives often form dense clusters (e.g., RFI), whereas true pulsars are sparse outliers. Inductively, graph autoencoders (Info 16) can model these relationships better than CNNs.

Theoretical Basis:
- Inductive Reasoning: Logical anomaly detection (Info 90) requires modeling feature relationships, which graph networks (Info 16) achieve by construction. Self-supervision (Info 197) bypasses the need for labeled rare pulsars.

Hypothesis 5: Temporal folding CNNs (TFCs) applied to pulsar periodograms will achieve higher time-series classification accuracy than RNNs by preserving phase coherence and mitigating vanishing gradients.

Derivation Process:
- Information Considered: 49, 66, 135, 180, 192
- Theory Applied: Deductive reasoning (temporal CNN superiority in sequential data)
- Reasoning: TFCs (Info 66,180) treat time as a spatial dimension, outperforming LSTMs on Sequential MNIST (Info 192). Pulsar periodograms are quasi-periodic 1D time-series; deductively applying TFCs (Info 49) should better capture phase shifts and harmonics than RNNs prone to gradient issues.

Theoretical Basis:
- Deductive Reasoning: Temporal CNNs theoretically preserve locality and parallelism better than RNNs (Info 180). For fixed-length pulsar folds (e.g., 1024-bin periodograms), this aligns with TFCs' strengths in Info 192.
