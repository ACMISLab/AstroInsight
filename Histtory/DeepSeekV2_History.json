Ensure that the extracted information meets the following requirements:\n\n1. **Avoid Demonstrative Pronouns**: Do not use demonstrative pronouns such as 'this', 'that', 'these', 'those', 'this work', 'this survey', 'the study', etc. Instead, use 'Related research'. Ensure that each piece of information is self-contained and clear.\n2. **Dataset Description Standards**: When describing datasets, not only specify which dataset was used, but also clearly state the source of the dataset and its intended purpose (e.g., The data comes from [data source] can be used in [research topic]. ).\n3. **Result Presentation Standards**: For experimental results, avoid using ambiguous phrases like \"the results indicate\" and instead use \"Related research show [experimental results],\" ensuring that the content of the experimental results is clear and specific.\n4. **Accuracy**: All information should be an explicit statement from the abstract, without personal speculation or interpretation.\n5. **Completeness**: Include all main factual points from the abstract, avoiding the omission of key information.\n6. **Conciseness**: Each fact should be a concise and clear statement.\n7. **Structured Format**: Present each factual information in a numbered list format, with each fact on a separate line.\n8. **Independence and Clarity**: Each piece of output information must be able to stand alone without context, with clear meaning, free from ambiguity or unclear references.\n\n# Example output format:\n\n1.Related research have shown that [research topic].\n2.Related research have used [methods], and find that [experimental results].\n3.The data comes from [data source] can be used in [research topic].\n4.Related research have shown that [experimental results].\n5.Related research have found that [conclusion]."

Largely based upon the infrastructure of Open source pulsar search and analysis toolkit (PRESTO), GSP implements GPU acceleration of the de-dispersion and integrates a candidate-archiving database. We applied GSP to the data streams from the commensal radio astronomy FAST survey (CRAFTS), which resulted in a quasi-real-time processing. The integrated candidate database facilitates synergistic usage of multiple machine-learning tools and thus improves efficient identification of radio pulsars such as rotating radio transients (RRATs) and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). We first tested GSP on pilot CRAFTS observations with the FAST Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) receiver. GSP detected all pulsars known from the the Parkes multibeam pulsar survey in the respective sky area covered by the FAST-UWB. GSP also discovered 13 new pulsars. We measured the computational efficiency of GSP to be ~120 times faster than the original PRESTO and ~60 times faster than a MPI-parallelized version of PRESTO.\n"
