The last updated date is 20231212'Reviewer 1: The proposed integrated framework for pulsar candidate classification is innovative and well-constructed, leveraging the strengths of Bayesian networks, automated feature engineering, and transformer-based deep learning models. One aspect that could be further explored is the potential for incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the Bayesian network construction. For instance, prior astronomical knowledge about the expected relationships between certain features (e.g., period and dispersion measure) could be encoded as priors in the Bayesian networks, potentially improving their robustness and interpretability. Additionally, while the use of Vision Transformer (ViT) and Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) is promising, it might be beneficial to also consider hybrid architectures that can more effectively handle both spatial and temporal dependencies, such as Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs). This could enhance the model's ability to capture long-term patterns in the time series data, which is crucial for accurate pulsar candidate classification. Finally, the integration of semisupervised learning techniques, particularly self-tuning pseudolabeling, is a strong point, but it would be valuable to explore how these methods can be fine-tuned to better handle the class imbalance often present in pulsar candidate datasets, perhaps by incorporating techniques like focal loss or other class-weighted loss functions.
Reviewer 2: The proposed integrated framework is commendable for its holistic approach to pulsar candidate classification.  While incorporating domain-specific knowledge into Bayesian networks is valuable, I suggest exploring the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to further enhance the framework's robustness and interpretability. GNNs excel at modeling complex relationships within data, potentially outperforming Bayesian networks in capturing intricate dependencies within pulsar candidate features. Integrating GNNs would allow for the representation of pulsar candidates as nodes in a graph, with edges reflecting the relationships between features. This approach would not only capture the nuanced structure of pulsar candidate data but also facilitate explainability, allowing researchers to interpret the learned relationships between features and identify crucial patterns for accurate classification. 

Reviewer 3: The proposed integrated framework for pulsar candidate classification is indeed a promising approach, combining the strengths of Bayesian networks, automated feature engineering, and transformer-based deep learning models. However, to further enhance the robustness and adaptability of the framework, I suggest exploring the potential of **ensemble learning techniques**. Specifically, integrating an ensemble of models that combine the outputs of Bayesian networks, automated feature engineering, and transformer-based deep learning could provide a more comprehensive and accurate classification system. This ensemble approach could mitigate the limitations of individual models, such as the potential overfitting of deep learning models or the underfitting of Bayesian networks, by leveraging the diverse strengths of each component. Additionally, the use of **meta-learning** techniques could be beneficial in fine-tuning the ensemble, allowing the system to adapt more effectively to new and unseen data, which is crucial for the dynamic and evolving nature of astronomical surveys. This ensemble-based meta-learning approach could significantly improve the generalization capabilities of the proposed framework, making it more robust and adaptable to a wide range of pulsar candidate classification tasks.
Reviewer 4: Recently, multimodal large language models have shown amazing capabilities, and I believe that using multimodal large language models for pulsar classification would be a good direction.
