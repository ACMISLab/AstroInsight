One aspect that could be further explored is the potential for incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the Bayesian network construction. For instance, prior astronomical knowledge about the expected relationships between certain features (e.g., period and dispersion measure) could be encoded as priors in the Bayesian networks, potentially improving their robustness and interpretability. Additionally, while the use of Vision Transformer (ViT) and Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) is promising, it might be beneficial to also consider hybrid architectures that can more effectively handle both spatial and temporal dependencies, such as Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs). This could enhance the model's ability to capture long-term patterns in the time series data, which is crucial for accurate pulsar candidate classification. Finally, the integration of semisupervised learning techniques, particularly self-tuning pseudolabeling, is a strong point, but it would be valuable to explore how these methods can be fine-tuned to better handle the class imbalance often present in pulsar candidate datasets, perhaps by incorporating techniques like focal loss or other class-weighted loss functions.", "name": "Reviewer 1"}

While incorporating domain-specific knowledge into Bayesian networks is valuable, I suggest exploring the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to further enhance the framework's robustness and interpretability.

Integrating GNNs would allow for the representation of pulsar candidates as nodes in a graph, with edges reflecting the relationships between features. This approach would not only capture the nuanced structure of pulsar candidate data but also facilitate explainability, allowing researchers to interpret the learned relationships between features and identify crucial patterns for accurate classification. \n", "name": "Reviewer 2"}
