The last updated date is 20231212'Reviewer 1: The proposed integrated framework for pulsar candidate classification is a promising approach that addresses the multifaceted challenges of handling vast and complex astronomical data. However, the draft could benefit from a more nuanced discussion on the scalability and computational efficiency of the proposed methods, particularly in the context of real-time processing and large-scale surveys. While the integration of Bayesian networks, automated feature engineering, and transformer-based deep learning models is innovative, the computational overhead of these combined techniques must be carefully considered. Additionally, the draft could explore the potential for parallelization and distributed computing to mitigate these challenges, ensuring that the framework remains practical for ongoing and future surveys. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of the trade-offs between model complexity and performance, particularly in terms of inference time and resource utilization, would strengthen the practical applicability of the proposed solution.
Reviewer 2: The proposed integrated framework for pulsar candidate classification is indeed a comprehensive and innovative approach, but it could be further strengthened by considering the interpretability of the models within the context of astronomical research. While the integration of Bayesian networks, automated feature engineering, and transformer-based deep learning models is expected to enhance accuracy and efficiency, the complexity of these models may obscure the underlying physical insights that are crucial for validating the classification results. Astronomers often require clear explanations of why a candidate is classified as a pulsar, particularly when dealing with rare or novel phenomena. Therefore, incorporating techniques for model interpretability, such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), could provide valuable insights into the decision-making process of the integrated model. This would not only enhance the trustworthiness of the results but also facilitate collaboration between machine learning experts and astronomers, ensuring that the model's predictions are aligned with established astrophysical principles. Additionally, exploring the use of interpretable neural networks, such as those with attention mechanisms, could offer a balance between high performance and interpretability, making the framework more accessible and actionable for the astronomical community.
Reviewer 3: The proposed integrated framework for pulsar candidate classification is a commendable effort that addresses the critical challenges of handling complex, multi-modal astronomical data. However, while the draft effectively outlines the technical components and their integration, it could benefit from a more strategic focus on the **adaptability and modularity** of the framework. Given the rapid advancements in both astronomical surveys and machine learning techniques, the framework should be designed to accommodate future innovations and updates without requiring a complete overhaul.

One potential enhancement could be the introduction of a **modular architecture** that allows individual components—such as Bayesian networks, automated feature engineering, and transformer-based models—to be easily swapped or upgraded. This modularity would not only facilitate the incorporation of new algorithms as they emerge but also enable researchers to fine-tune specific components without disrupting the entire system. For instance, if a new feature engineering technique is developed, it could be integrated into the AutoFE module without affecting the Bayesian network or transformer models.

Additionally, the draft could explore the potential for **incremental learning** within the framework. Incremental learning techniques, which allow models to update their knowledge as new data becomes available, could be particularly valuable in the context of ongoing astronomical surveys. This approach would enable the framework to continuously improve its classification accuracy and efficiency without the need for retraining on the entire dataset, thereby reducing computational costs and ensuring that the model remains up-to-date with the latest observations.

By emphasizing adaptability and modularity, the framework would not only enhance its practical applicability but also position itself as a robust and future-proof solution for pulsar candidate classification in both current and upcoming astronomical surveys.
Reviewer 4: I think incorporating multimodal large language model technology could be a good direction. If multimodal large language modeling technology is applied to pulsar classification, can it achieve the fusion of physical and image features?
